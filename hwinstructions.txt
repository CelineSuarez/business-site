3. Create a Business Website Using one of the free themes http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/small-business/ (Links to an external site.) or http://html5templatesdreamweaver.com/free-templates.html (Links to an external site.)

Use the Laravel Framework to create the database and structure.

Requirements:

 

Contact Page

This page will allow the user to send us an email. Use flash messages or separate pages to notify the user that their message was sent/or error messages.

Home Page

The home page will have a form that will allow the user to add their email address to the marketing email database.

Have a confirmation page and/or flash message to let the user know we were able to successfully add their email address

Services

Purely informative, create at least 3 services and/or use Lorem Ipsum text as placeholders

 

This is intentionally vague to allow for you to discover your own way to solve this problem.

 

Pointers:

You can create a controller per page or create one main controller with each page being a function of that controller.

 

Rubric:

What I'm looking for is the proper utilization of controllers, models, views and routes and to see how quickly you are able to grasp the concepts of MVC in a new framework.
