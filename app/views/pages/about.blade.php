	<p class="lead"> Senzu Beans are grown by Korin in Korin Tower. When eaten, the consumer's energy and physical health are 
		restored to their fullest; the effects are typically almost instantaneous for the recipient, 
		making these beans a great asset both in and out of battle. Their texture is said to be a cross between an 
		uncooked (or under ripe) bean and a celery stalk, and Yajirobe states that Senzu Beans taste like fish.[1] 
		One bean can keep a person full for ten days,[2] though some who have eaten the beans have become hungry sooner, 
		due to their naturally larger appetite (namely Saiyans as they generally eat much larger amounts of food). It has 
		been seen that eating too many Senzu Beans at a time is dangerous, as when they are first introduced, Yajirobe is 
		flabbergasted that the only thing Korin has to eat are "beans", and so he eats a few handfuls of Senzu Beans, 
		which resulted in him comically gaining about a pound for every bean he ate. Since Korin allied himself with Goku 
		and his friends, Korin usually assists them by providing the Z Fighters with a sack of beans whenever possible as it 
		takes time to grow even a single bean. </p>
